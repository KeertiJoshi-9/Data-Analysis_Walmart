**Walmart - Confidence Interval and CLT**

Business Problem:
The Management team at Walmart Inc. wants to analyze the customer purchase behavior (specifically, purchase amount) against the customer’s gender and the various other factors to help the business make better decisions. 
They want to understand if the spending habits differ between male and female customers: Do women spend more on Black Friday than men? (Assume 50 million customers are male and 50 million are female).

**Insights-**
1. Walmart can keep products like P00265242 and P00025442 (which are selling a lot) in the inventory. Products like P00056342 P00350742 (which are not selling) need not be kept in store.
2. Ads can be targeted towards people of age group 26–35, since they are making maximum purchases. Walmart can also include new products required by people of this age group.
3. Ads can be targeted towards people of city category B. Inventory in these cities can be replenished.
4. Ads can be targeted towards people who have spent between 1 to 2 years in their cities.
5. Ads can be targeted towards unmarried people.
6. Products of categories 1, 5 and 8 can be kept in inventory as well as made easily visible in the stores.

**Recommendations-**
1. Target Male Shoppers Since male customers account for a significant portion of Black Friday sales and tend to spend more per transaction on average, Walmart should tailor its marketing strategies and product offerings to incentivize higher spending among male customers while ensuring competitive pricing for female oriented products.
2. Focus on 26 - 45 Age Group With the age group between 26 and 45 contributing to the majority of sales, Walmart should specifically cater to the preferences and needs of this demographic.This could include offering exclusive deals on products that are popular among this age group.
3. Engage Younger Shoppers Knowing that customers in the 0 - 17 age group have the lowest spending per transaction, Walmart can try to increase their spending per transaction by offering them more attractive discounts, coupons, or rewards programs. It’s essential to start building brand loyalty among younger consumers.
4. Customer Segmentation --> Since customers in the 18 - 25, 26 - 35, and 46 - 50 age groups exhibit similar buying characteristics, and so do the customers in 36 - 45 and 55+, Walmart can optimize its product selection to cater to the preferences of these age groups. Also, Walmart can use this information to adjust their pricing strategies for different age groups.
5. Enhance the 51 - 55 Age Group Shopping Experience Considering that customers aged 51 - 55 have the highest spending per transaction, Walmart offer them exclusive pre-sale access, special discount or provide personalized product recommendations for this age group. Walmart can also introduce loyalty programs specifically designed to reward and retain customers in the 51 - 55 age group.
6. Post-Black Friday Engagement After Black Friday, walmart should engage with customers who made purchases by sending follow-up emails or offers for related products. This can help increase customer retention and encourage repeat business throughout the holiday season and beyond.
